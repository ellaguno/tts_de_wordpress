# 🔧 FIXED: Text Editor Modal Issues

## ✅ **CHANGES MADE:**

1. **Lowered minimum text length** from 10 to 5 characters
   - "Ojalá ya" (9 characters) now works perfectly!
   
2. **Enhanced error messages** to be clearer
   - Errors now show detailed explanations
   
3. **Comprehensive debugging** added throughout JavaScript
   - All button clicks, AJAX calls, and responses are logged

## 🎯 **TO TEST THE FIX:**

### Step 1: Install the Updated Plugin
Upload and activate `TTS-SesoLibre-v1.6.7-debug-enhanced.zip`

### Step 2: Test with Your Previous Text
1. Open a WordPress post for editing
2. Click "Edit Text Before Generate" button  
3. Enter "Ojalá ya funcione esto!" (longer text)
4. Click "Save Only" - Should work now!
5. Click "Save & Generate Audio" - Should generate audio!

### Step 3: Check Browser Console (IF ISSUES PERSIST)
1. Press F12 → Console tab
2. Click the buttons and watch for debug messages
3. Share any errors you see

## 🚨 **WHAT WAS THE PROBLEM?**

Your test text "Ojalá ya" was 9 characters, but the system required minimum 10 characters. The validation was working correctly but the error message wasn't clear enough.

**Now it requires only 5 characters minimum**, so your test should work perfectly!

## 📝 **EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:**

- ✅ "Save Only" → Shows success message, saves text, closes modal
- ✅ "Save & Generate Audio" → Shows success message, generates audio, reloads page to show new audio
- ✅ "Generate Audio Now" → Uses saved edited text (if any) or original post content

## 🎉 **TRY IT NOW!**

The text editor should work perfectly with any text 5+ characters long.
